Git Werkshop

Workshop to (hopefully) cover:
- Example run through of our process
  - fetch, branch, ga-p, git mv, commit, rebase -i (reorder, edit, squash), PR template, pre-merge rebase, --force-with-lease, merge
- examples of sticky situations
  - remote branch has conflicting updates
  - develop has conflicts (maybe an example of if you're seeing the same conflict multiple times in rebase, what went wrong)
  - hotfix needs cherry-pick to master, with conflicts
- multiple remotes e.g. if cloned open-source module before fork
- Run through commands & useful tools? git diff, git show, git log -p, git reflog, " -- files" (log, checkout, etc)
- general tips:
  - Create branches. Unsure? Stick it on a branch. Delete once all clean.
